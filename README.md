# SOLID Principles - Code Examples in Two Languages

Welcome to the **SOLID Principles** teaching repository!  
This repo provides clear and practical code examples demonstrating the **SOLID** principles of object-oriented design. For each principle, you will find **before** and **after** refactorings in two programming languages.

## What is SOLID?

SOLID is an acronym for five key design principles that help developers write maintainable, extensible, and robust object-oriented code:

- **S**ingle Responsibility Principle (SRP)  
  A class should have only one reason to change, meaning it should have a single responsibility.

- **O**pen/Closed Principle (OCP)  
  Software entities should be open for extension but closed for modification.

- **L**iskov Substitution Principle (LSP)  
  Objects of a superclass should be replaceable with objects of subclasses without affecting the correctness of the program.

- **I**nterface Segregation Principle (ISP)  
  Clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they do not use.

- **D**ependency Inversion Principle (DIP)  
  High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions.

## How to Use

1. Choose the language folder you want to explore.
2. Pick a principle folder (SRP, OCP, LSP, ISP, DIP).
3. Compare the `before` and `after` codes to understand how to apply the principle.
4. Read the code comments for explanations of the changes.

## Why Learn SOLID?

Applying SOLID principles helps you:

- Write cleaner, more understandable code.
- Reduce bugs and make your code easier to test.
- Make your codebase easier to extend with new features.
- Facilitate teamwork by improving code readability and design consistency.
